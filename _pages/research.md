### Abstract 
Since their discovery, sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) have been a puzzling phenomenon because they appear to be redder and under-luminous compared to normal subgiant and giant stars on a color magnitude diagram (CMD). One hypothesis is that SSGs are rapidly rotating stars in tight binary orbits. Rapid rotation generates strong magnetic fields, and these magnetic fields may inhibit convection, causing stars to be cooler and larger than predicted by standard stellar models. We present a sample of stellar spectra taken with the Robert G. Tull Coud√© spectrograph on the 2.7 m Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory for a sample of 74 SSGs. We analyze the H-alpha line region of the spectra. The SSGs are categorized into three distinct categories: H-alpha emission lines only, H-alpha absorption lines only, and variable H-alpha. We find that H-alpha variability is the most common H-alpha profile type amongst SSGs, followed by absorption lines only, and standard emission as the least common H-alpha profile. We also analyze the Calcium II H and K line region, finding widespread Ca II H & K emission but with less variability than observed in H-alpha. We conclude that SSGs show some signs of chromospheric activity, which is indicative of strong magnetic activity, but that an additional component may be needed to explain the complex line profile shapes of the H-alpha features.
