I am Elaine Bai and I am a fourth year astrophysics and physics student at the Illinois institute of Technology. I am primarly intrested in observational stellar astronomy and transients. This summer, I worked with professor Adam Miller on finding the Redshift Completeness Fraction - the fraction of galaxies whose redshifts are known - of Nearby Galaxies.
